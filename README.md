# Computational prediction of patients diagnosis and feature selection applied to a mesothelioma dataset
Computational prediction of patients diagnosis and feature selection applied to a mesothelioma dataset

## Installation
To run the scripts, you need to have installed:
* **R** (version 3.3.2)
* R packages **rgl**, **clusterSim** and **randomForest**
* **Python 3**
* Python package **xlsx2csv**
* **git** (version 1.8.3.1)
* **Torch** (version 7)
* **LuaRocks** (version 2.3.0)

You need to have root privileges, an internet connection, and at least 1 GB of free space on your hard disk. We here provide the instructions to install all the needed programs and dependencies on Linux CentOS, Linux Ubuntu, and Mac OS. Our scripts were originally developed on a Linux Ubuntu computer.

### Dependency installation for Linux Ubuntu
<img src="http://www.internetpost.it/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ubuntu-head.png" width="150" align="right">
Here are the instructions to install all the programs and libraries needed by our scripts on a Linux Ubuntu computer, from a shell terminal. We tested these instructions on a Dell Latitude 3540 laptop, running Linux Ubuntu 16.10 operating system, and having a 64-bit kernel, in February 2017. If you are using another operating system version, some instructions might be slightly different.

(Optional) First of all, update:<br>
`sudo apt-get update`<br>

Install R and its rgl, clusterSim, randomForest packages:<br>
`sudo apt-get -y install r-base-core`<br>
`sudo apt-get -y install r-cran-rgl`<br>
`sudo Rscript -e 'install.packages(c("rgl", "clusterSim", "randomForest"), repos="https://cran.rstudio.com")'`<br>

Install xlsx2csv and git:<br>
`sudo apt-get -y install xlsx2csv`<br>
`sudo apt-get -y install git`<br>

Install Torch and luarocks:<br>
`# in a terminal, run the commands WITHOUT sudo`<br>
`git clone https://github.com/torch/distro.git ~/torch --recursive`<br>
`cd ~/torch; bash install-deps;`<br>
`./install.sh`<br>

`source ~/.bashrc`<br>
`cd ~`<br>

`sudo apt-get -y install luarocks`<br>
`sudo luarocks install csv`<br>

### Dependency installation for Linux CentOS

`sudo yum -y install luarocks` <br>
`sudo luarocks install csv` <br>


### Dependency installation for Mac OS
<img src="https://www.technobuffalo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Mac-OS-logo.jpg" width="150" align="right">
Here are the instructions to install all the programs and libraries needed by our scripts on a Mac computer, from a shell terminal. We tested these instructions on an Apple computer running a Mac OS macOS 10.12.2 Sierra operating system, in March 2017. If you are using another operating system version, some instructions might be slightly different.

(Optional) First of all, update:<br>
`sudo softwareupdate -iva`<br>

Manually download and install XQuartz from https://www.xquartz.org <br>

Install R and its packages:<br>
`brew install r`<br>
`sudo Rscript -e 'install.packages(c("rgl”, "clusterSim”, "randomForest”), repos="https://cran.rstudio.com")' `<br>

`curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rudix-mac/rpm/2016.12.13/rudix.py`<br>
`sudo python rudix.py install rudix`<br>

Install the development tools (such as gcc):<br>
`xcode-select --install`<br>

Install xlsx2csv:<br>
`sudo easy_install xlsx2csv` <br>

Install Torch and laurocks:<br>

`cd ~/torch; bash install-deps`<br>
`./install.sh`<br>
`cd ~`<br>

`brew install lua`<br>
`source ~/.profile`<br>
`sudo luarocks install csv`<br>

## Dataset preparation

Move to the project main directory, then use the script to download the mesothelioma dataset file, normalize the columns, and remove the "diagnosis method" feature (that is a duplicate of the target feature "class of diagnosis"):<br><br>
`cd /mesothelioma-diagnosis-predictions/` <br><br>
`./script_prepare_dataset.sh` <br>


## Execution for all (Linux Ubuntu, Linux CentOS, and Mac)

### Diagnosis prediction

To run the Torch software of the perceptron-based artificial neural network:<br>
`th mesothelioma_ann_script_val.lua` <br>

To run the Python 3 software of the probabilistic neural network:<br>
`python3 pnn_mesothelioma_initial_py3.py` <br>

To run the R software of the random forest classifier:<br>
`Rscript random_forests_class.r`

To run the R software of the CART classifier:<br>
`Rscript cart.r`

To run the R software of the onre rule classifier:<br>
`Rscript oner_class.r`

### Feature selection

To run the random forest R code for feature selection:<br>
`Rscript random_forests.r Mesothelioma_data_set_COL_NORM.csv` <br><br>
